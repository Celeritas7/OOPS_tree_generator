ok. remeber this discussion below. And update the app.







I'm choosing "Option B: The "Folder" Approach (One File per Project)" for a time being.  



You are absolutely right. If you put 50 projects into one file, that file becomes a "heavy" giant. You have two main ways to handle this in a JSON-based system:

Option A: The "One Big File" (Monolithic)

This is what we've discussed so far.





How it works: All projects live inside projects.json.



The Problem: As you suspected, every time you save a tiny change in project #50, you have to rewrite the data for projects #1 through #49 as well.



When it breaks: If each project has 500 lines of code, 50 projects is 25,000 lines of text. While modern computers handle this easily, it becomes slow to "fetch" over the internet if your app is web-based.

Option B: The "Folder" Approach (One File per Project)

This is how professional IDEs (like VS Code or PyCharm) and even many video games handle save data. Instead of one giant JSON, you create a directory structure.

The Structure:

Plaintext

/my_app_data
  ├── index.json          (A small list of project names and their IDs)
  ├── project_1.json      (Only contains the code for "Quiz Brain")
  ├── project_2.json      (Only contains the code for "Snake Game")
  └── project_3.json      (Only contains the code for "Weather App")


Why this is better:





Efficiency: To update "Quiz Brain," the app only opens and overwrites project_1.json. It doesn't touch the other files.



Safety: If project_3.json gets corrupted or deleted, your other 49 projects are perfectly safe.



Speed: Your app loads the small index.json first to show the menu. It only downloads the "heavy" code file when the user actually clicks on that specific project.

Which one should you choose?

If you are building the tool shown in your image (the Python Structure Visualizer):





Start with Option A if you just want to get it working quickly. It's easier to write the code for one file.



Switch to Option B once you notice the app "stutters" when saving, or if you want to allow users to download their projects individually.

The "Hybrid" Secret:

Actually, many apps use Option B locally (on your computer) but then "zip" them all together or use an SQL database when they move to a professional cloud server. SQL is essentially like having Option B, but the computer manages the "files" for you inside one database engine.

Since you are visualizing Python classes, would you like to see how to structure the "index.json" so it can quickly point to the correct project file?
